The pieces fall straight down, occupying the next available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs. Connect Four is a solved game. The first player can always win by playing the right moves.</span></p>

                        The first player begins by dropping his/her red disc into the center column of the game board. The two players then alternate turns dropping one of their discs at a time into an unfilled column, until the second player, with black discs, achieves four discs in a row, diagonally, and wins. If the game board fills before either player achieves four in a row, then the game is a draw.</span></p>

                        Connect Four is a two-player game with "perfect information". This term describes games where one player at a time plays, players have all the information about moves that have taken place, and all moves that can take place, for a given game state. Connect Four also belongs to the classification of an adversarial, zero-sum game, since a player's advantage is an opponent's disadvantage.</span></p>
                    <p><span style="color: #000000;">
                        One measure of complexity of the Connect Four game is the number of possible games board positions. For classic Connect Four played on 6 high, 7 wide grid, there are 4,531,985,219,092 positions for all game boards populated with 0 to 42 pieces.</span></p>
                    <p><span style="color: #000000;">
                        The game was first solved&nbsp;by James Dow Allen (October 1, 1988), and independently by Victor Allis&nbsp;(October 16, 1988).&nbsp;<sup id="cite_ref-Tromp_4-0" class="reference"></sup>
                        Allis describes a knowledge based approach,<sup id="cite_ref-Allis_5-0" class="reference"></sup>&nbsp;with nine strategies, as a solution for Connect Four. Allen also describes winning strategies&nbsp;<sup id="cite_ref-Allen_6-0" class="reference"></sup>
                        in his analysis of the game. At the time of the initial solutions for Connect Four, brute force analysis was not deemed feasible given the game's complexity and the computer technology available at the time.</span></p>
                    <p><span style="color: #000000;">
                        Connect Four has since been solved with brute force methods beginning with John Tromp's work in compiling an 8-ply database (Feb 4, 1995). The artificial intelligence algorithms able to strongly solve Connect Four are minmax or&nbsp;negmax, with optimizations that include alpha-beta pruning, move ordering, and&nbsp;transposition&nbsp;tables. The code for solving Connect Four with these methods is also the basis for the&nbsp;Fhourstones integer performance benchmark.</span></p>
                    <p><span style="color: #000000;">
                        The solved conclusion for Connect Four is first player win. With prefect play, the first player can force a win,&nbsp;<sup id="cite_ref-Tromp_4-2" class="reference"></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Allis_5-1" class="reference"></sup>
                        on or before the 41st move (ply) by starting in the middle column. The game is a theoretical draw when the first player starts in the columns adjacent to the center. For the edges of the game board, column 1 and 2 on left (or column 7 and 6 on right), the exact move-value score for first player start is loss on the 40th move, and loss on the 42nd move,&nbsp;<sup id="cite_ref-c4solve_10-2" class="reference"></sup>
                        respectively. In other words, by starting with the four outer columns, the first player allows the second player to force a win.</span></p>
